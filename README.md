---

## Objective
To perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews using TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression.

---

## Dataset
customers_reviews.csv

Contains customer demographics, ratings, and review text

---

## Sentiment labels were derived from ratings:
  - Rating ≥ 4 → Positive
  - Rating ≤ 2 → Negative
  - Rating = 3 → Neutral (excluded)
    
---

## Techniques Used
  - Text preprocessing
  - TF-IDF Vectorization
  - Logistic Regression
  - Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

---

## Outcome
The model successfully classified customer sentiments. High accuracy was observed due to a small and imbalanced dataset, which is explained as a dataset limitation.
